# Vehicle Collision Analysis in NYC (2015-2016)

## Overview

This project analyzes NYC vehicle collision data (2015-2016) to enhance road safety. We examined over 10,000 records to identify key patterns and factors affecting accident severity.

## Tech Skills

- **Languages:** Python
- **Database:** MongoDB
- **Analysis Tools:** Pymongo, Pandas, NumPy
- **Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **IDE's:** Jupyter Notebook, IntelliJ

## Problems Solved

1. **Geospatial Distribution:**
   - **Finding:** Brooklyn and Queens have the highest number of accidents (over 40% of total incidents), while Staten Island, despite having fewer accidents, has the highest fatality rate (20% of fatal accidents).

2. **Driver Distractions:**
   - **Finding:** Driver inattention/distraction is involved in 25% of accidents with injuries. Failure to yield/right of way causes 30% of serious injuries and fatalities.

3. **Vehicle Type Analysis:**
   - **Finding:** Passenger vehicles account for 50% of accidents. Motorcycles and bicycles have injury rates exceeding 50%, while large commercial vehicles are involved in 15% of fatal accidents.

4. **Weather Impact:**
   - **Finding:** 
     - **Accidents:** 35% occur in rainy or snowy conditions.
     - **Injuries:** Highest injury rates are observed in partially cloudy (25%) and rainy conditions (20%).
     - **Fatalities:** Partially cloudy and rainy conditions show 15% higher fatality rates compared to clear weather.

## Key Findings

- **Geospatial Insights:** Brooklyn and Queens have high accident rates; Staten Island shows a higher fatality rate despite fewer accidents.
- **Driver Distractions:** Inattention and failure to yield are major factors, contributing to 55% of severe outcomes.
- **Vehicle Types:** Two-wheelers face the highest injury rates (>50%); large vehicles have significant fatality rates.
- **Weather Factors:** Rain and partially cloudy conditions are associated with increased fatality rates, though overall weather impact on accident frequency is minimal.

## Conclusion

The analysis provides actionable insights to improve road safety, focusing on high-risk areas, driver behavior, and vehicle types.
